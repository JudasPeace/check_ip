# check_ip
Just a Perl Regex to check if an IP address is valid


I went for an interview at Arm in Cambridge, UK. They asked me to write one on
the board and I wrote some lame one .. and later ... brooding on my poor
attempt set out to make a better one. Driven by failure? Or maybe just really
irritated by it. I still got the job :)
